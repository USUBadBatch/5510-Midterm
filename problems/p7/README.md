Implement an A* based planner (an example is found [here:](https://medium.com/@nicholas.w.swift/easy-a-star-pathfinding-7e6689c7f7b2)) and
compare it’s results with the Djikstra, A-Star, RRT-Star, Bi-Directional A-Star,
and the Breadth First Search Planners from this [github.](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master/PathPlanning). Create a table com-
paring the average cost of the path found over 10 iterations along with the time to
convergence.
After you have implemented your planner and compared it answer the below ques-
tions.
•Which planner provided a path with the lowest cost on average?
•Which one found a path the fastest on average?
•After comparing your planner to these five other ones is there anything you
would change in your planner to help it converge faster or find a path with a
better cost?
•Which planner appears to be the best overall? Which planner would you use
for a robot in a complex environment?


Are we supposed to run our A Star algo in the same way as the other algorithms? same environment and everythin? Or are we
supposed to come up with something ourselves.  

Is the cost the number of iterations? or FLOPs or what?
Are we allowed to modify the starter code?
