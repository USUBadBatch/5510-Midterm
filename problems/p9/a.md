(5 points) Many people (particularly those in the robotics industry) believe that
robotics is purely within the purview of technical development and should not have
any ethical considerations. What do you feel can be a merit or demerit to this way
of thinking?

I feel that there is an absolute need for ethics in robotics.  If we were to allow anyone to do anything with robotics there could be serious problems.  I can see how the argument that robotics shouldn't have any ethical considerations would be appealing to some.  The lack of societal oversight could lead some to do some truly dastardly deeds on a large scale.  It could also cause problems on a smaller scale.  

A simple example could be that a robot could be representing someone in a court of law.  If they were to not consider ethics and instead focus on bringing the truth forward, this robot could walk to the jury and replay the client admitting to breaking the law.  This would violate the attorney client priviledge and would cause problems on it's own.

Now, that would be an example of the need for a single robot's internal programming needing to consider ethics as part of its decision making process.  As for the field of robotics as a whole, there still needs to be ethical considerations.  Most research and development is done with some sort of motivation.  Whether or not that is the motivation of the individual researcher or the motivation of a sponsor who is willing to financially support or support by other means, the discovery process.  These motivations have largely shaped and guided scientific development throughout history.  If we as a people and as a scientific body were to let go of ethics in scientific development and especially with regards to the topic of robotics we would expect to see development start reaching to areas that could be dangerous in a plethora of different realms, including but certainly not limited to physical health, econimic stability, societal values, and environmental balance.  

Some of the potential merits of this way of thinking could be founded on the fact that the ethics don't always provide the best way of doing things or in worst case actually bring a detriment to those who follow them.  In this case, focusing on the technical development instead of ethical considerations would bring more benefit to more people.
