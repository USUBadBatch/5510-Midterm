(5 points) Many people (particularly those in the robotics industry) believe that
robotics is purely within the purview of technical development and should not have
any ethical considerations. What do you feel can be a merit or demerit to this way
of thinking?

I feel that there is an absolute need for ethics in robotics.  If we were to allow anyone to do anything with robotics, there could be serious problems.  I can see how the argument that robotics shouldn't have any ethical considerations would be appealing to some; however, the lack of societal oversight could lead some to do some truly dastardly deeds on both a larger scale and smaller scale.  

A simple example could be if a robot is representing someone in a court of law.  If they were to not consider ethics and instead focus on bringing the truth forward, this robot could walk to the jury and replay the client admitting to breaking the law.  This would violate the attorney client privilege and would cause problems on it's own.

Now, that would be an example of the need for a single robot's internal programming needing to consider ethics as part of its decision making process.  As for the field of robotics as a whole, there still needs to be ethical considerations.  Most research and development is done with some sort of motivation.  Whether or not that is the motivation of the individual researcher or the motivation of a sponsor who is willing to support the discovery process, these motivations have largely shaped and guided scientific development throughout history.  If we as a people and as a scientific body were to let go of ethics in scientific development, especially with regards to the topic of robotics, we would expect to see development start reaching areas that could be dangerous in a plethora of different realms, including but certainly not limited to physical health, economic stability, societal values, and environmental balance.  

Some of the potential merits of considering robotics solely within the purview of technical development could be founded on the fact that the ethics don't always provide the best guidance in the development of the technology, or in worst case actually bring a detriment to those who follow them.  In this case, focusing on the technical development instead of ethical considerations would bring more benefit to more people.  Attempting to follow the ethical standards that are in place today could hinder the development of technology within robotics that could greatly improve our daily lives.
